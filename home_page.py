Looking at the dependency ratio of all independent variables, Water availability, and Humidity play a vital role in the harvesting season prediction according to regions.
The label or dependent variable in the dataset is harvest season, and the countries include, Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Sudan, with four harvest seasons which include rainy, winter, summer, and spring.
The table below shows a sample dataset used for the model training."""
